## Results

This section provides an overview of the experimental outcomes from RDF processing on the cloud, including stress testing and performance analysis.

# Loading and Querying Test Results:

The results for RDF data loading and query execution tests are available in this section. These tests focus on evaluating the efficiency of loading RDF datasets into the cloud environment and the performance of RDF queries executed on those datasets.

The key performance metrics such as time taken for data loading, resource consumption during the loading process, and query execution times are detailed in these results.


# Stress Testing Results:

The stress tests assess how the system performs under high volumes of querying, simulating real-world scenarios where multiple clients simultaneously access the database. Using multiprocessing, we were able to replicate concurrent querying by numerous clients, testing the system's ability to handle a significant load. A total of 10 stress tests were conducted to measure scalability, query performance, and system robustness. Detailed stress test results, including execution times and query success rates, are available in this directory.
